andruinoA1: Low-cost educational mobile robot based on Android and Arduino
==========

This project presents the design of an open educational low-cost (less than 35€, phone not-included) modular and extendable mobile robot based on Android and Arduino, with WLAN and Internet connection capabilities, to be used as an educational tool in labs and classrooms of ICT vocational training, or in engineering courses, as well as in e-learning or MOOC courses as an alternative or complementary to virtual labs. It is a first step introducing what we call “BYOR: Bring Your Own Robot” education policy equivalent to “BYOD: Bring your own devices” in computers' world.
